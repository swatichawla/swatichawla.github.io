	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> I am a Ph.D candidate in history at the University of Virginia, and a Praxis fellow in digital humanities. I hold BA, MA, and M Phil degrees in English from the University of Delhi, and taught there as an assistant professor and guest lecturer from 2008-13. I am curious about why and how people make their homes in new places, and what this movement does to the spaces they move to and leave behind. All four of my grandparents had migrated from Sargodha in present-day Pakistan to Delhi in 1947, and I grew up on stories of the Partition of India. My doctoral work is focused on Tibetan exile in India, an interest that began with a summer’s stay at a Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in 2004. I write short-stories and poems, and am a part of the urban writers’ collective New Aesthetic. </p>
